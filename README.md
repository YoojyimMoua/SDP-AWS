# For Assignment 5. I had an issue with my s3 bucket at first, but was able to resolve by making sure I hosted my bucket in the correct location and added the correct permissions to the IAM role.
# You'll need to host your own s3 bucket with the java zip file and replace the "Bucket" name on line 70 with your own so that CloudFormation will create the stack without errors.
